Instructions: 

For Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression:

To see results of hyperparameter tuning, run ift6390_kaggle_2-naive_bayes_and_logreg_tuning.py.

To get predictions of tuned Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models, run ift6390_kaggle_2-naive_bayes_and_logreg_final.py.

For basic neural network:

Import basic_nn_Kaggle_2_ML.ipynb to Google Colab and mount associated data, then run all cells.

For explainability:

Run all cells in explainability.ipynb.
