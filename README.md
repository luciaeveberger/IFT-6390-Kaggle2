# IFT-6390-Kaggle2

Instructions: 

# Kaggle Code: 

The Methods are split by jupyter notebook and corresponding py files 

### For Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression:

To see results of hyperparameter tuning, run `code/ift6390_kaggle_2-naive_bayes_and_logreg_tuning.py`.

To get predictions of tuned Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models, run `code/ift6390_kaggle_2-naive_bayes_and_logreg_final.py`.

### For basic neural network:

Import `code/ift6390_kaggle_2basic_nn_Kaggle_2_ML.ipynb` to Google Colab and mount associated data, then run all cells.
To get predictions, run `code/ift6390_kaggle_2_basic_nn_Kaggle_2_ML.py`.

### For SVM: 
Import `code/ift6390_kaggle_2-BiLSTM_BestPredictions.ipynb` and mount associated data and rull cells. 
This can also be run as a python script: `code/ift6390_kaggle_2_SVM Method and Other.py`

### For biLSTM + Conformer

Import `code/ift6390_kaggle_2-BiLSTM_BestPredictions.ipynb` and mount associated data and rull cells. 
This can also be run: `code/ift6390_kaggle_2-bilstm_bestpredictions.py`.

# For explainability:

Run all cells in `Explainability_Final.ipynb`. Github will not render this larger file. Please load it:
